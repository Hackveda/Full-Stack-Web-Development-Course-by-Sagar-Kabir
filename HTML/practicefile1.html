          <p>  "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website
          or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it
        to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. </p>

          <p>   An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
